There is no way that I could describe my emotions for this movie. I'm totally speechless. Even I laughed (even cried) this much in Marvel movie or even in any movie. I'm fully on my emotion, there are so many tears of joy and loss. Amazing story But I iron man missing now, the acting is outstanding, epic action, great CGI, the best storytelling ever told in a superhero movie, amazing performance. But there is one thing I really hate hate hate the part that Tony Stark a.k.a. iron man died, It's really Make me sad, I must say that I am disappointed. I love it more than 3000. Happiness, sadness, pure joy, excitement... I'm gonna miss this moment in my whole life because let's face it's been awhile movies can bring such a big enthusiasm like this. It is such an experience you'll gonna remember it forever. People are laughing, crying, hate, full of a state emotion. It's 3 hours long but it went by like a finger, and now thinking I'm actually in Quantum Realm because it felt like 5 seconds. Even though you know where the story is gonna bring you because it's still a 'superhero movie' but it left me speechless. It's not just a superhero movie, it's more than that.
